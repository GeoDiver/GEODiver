# Contributing to GeoDiver

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GeoDiver and joining us :tada:

GeoDiver is an open source project that aims to build an easy and simple way to analyse gene expresion microarray data.

We welcome all kinds of contributions at all levels of experience, either code, knowledge, questions or suggestions. Many of our goals and GitHub issues do not require biology knowledge (e.g. very technical, coding).

 
## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [ismail.moghul@gmail.com](mailto:ismail.moghul@gmail.com).


## What we're working on

Take a look at tthe [Github Issues](https://github.com/GeoDiver/GeoDiver/issues) to see what needs to be done. If you have a specific idea that you want to work on (e.g. add an amazing new feature to GeoDiver etc.), that's cool as well.

However, it's always a good idea to [talk to us first](#communication_channels). Specially if you intend to take on something big, just to make sure we're on the same track. :wink:

1. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository** that the issue belongs to. This makes your own version of the tool/library that you can edit and use.
2. **[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine. Once you're happy with your changes...
3. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.

## Publishing Update Papers

Once we reach major milestones, we will aim to publish an update paper. Everyone who has contributed to making that milestone (how major/minor) will be invited to collaborate on producing and publishing a paper that would then be sent to peer-reviewed journal.
